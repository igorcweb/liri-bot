A command line node app that takes in parameters and returns data.
The following commands can be used: `spotify-this-song`, `movie-this`, `get-weather`, and `do-what-it-says`.

When the app is successfully used for the first time, `log.text` file is created. All of the consequent data is being logged to this file.
